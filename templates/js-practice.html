<h1>JavaScript Practice</h1>
<p>
  For each numbered problem, fill in the corresponding <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
  section in the source with JavaScript to solve the problem. The location of
  this file is <strong>templates/js-practice.html</strong>.</p>
<p>
  <b>Note:</b> you should only add JavaScript; you cannot change the HTML otherwise <b>at all</b>.
</p>

<h2>Plain JavaScript</h2>
<p>You may not use jQuery for this section!</p>



<h3>Making an Event Handler</h3>
<p>
  Make this button pop up an alert box in the
  browser window.
</p>

<fieldset>
<input type="button" value="Show Me a Popup!" id="popup-alert-button">
</fieldset>

<script>
  "use strict";

  var button = document.getElementById('popup-alert-button');

  function alertClick(evt){
    alert("Look at me pop-up!");
  }

  button.addEventListener('click', alertClick);
</script>



<h3>Practicing Your Times Tables</h3>
<p>
  When the user submits the form below, by default it will go to <code>/nope</code>.
</p>
<p>
  1) Prevent this from happening.
</p>
<p>
  2) Instead, read the values in from the form and create an array containing multiples of the requested number, up to (and including) the requested maximum.
</p>
<p>
  3) Print the array you have made to the console.
</p>

<fieldset>
  <form id="multiplying-form" action="/nope">
    I want all multiples of
    <select id="mults-of" name="mults-of">
      <option value="2">2</option>
      <option value="3">3</option>
      <option value="4">4</option>
      <option value="5">5</option>
      <option value="6">6</option>
      <option value="7">7</option>
      <option value="8">8</option>
      <option value="9">9</option>
    </select>
    up to
    <input id="max" type="number" name="up-to">.
    <input id="multiply-btn" type="submit" value="Go!">
  </form>

</fieldset>

<script>
  "use strict";

  // code here for the above problem

</script>

<div class="hint">
  <div>
    You'll need to cast the form values to integers.
  </div>
</div>


<h3>Reversing a String</h3>
<p>
  There's some incomplete JavaScript code below. When the button is pushed, it pops up an alert box with a message. Before the <code>alert</code> function runs, reverse the order of the string "Porcupines are cute" (which becomes "etuc era senipucroP"), and make that the contents of the alert. You must do this reversal programmatically; you cannot just type in the reversed string yourself!
</p>

<fieldset>
  <input type="button" id="reverse-string-button" value="!nottuB">
</fieldset>

<script>
  "use strict";

//  Here's a stub of a function you can use!

//  function reverseString(evt) {
//    var msg = "Porcupines are cute";
//
//    // do some stuff here to reverse that string into a new variable
//    var newMsg = "This should be the reversed string";
//
//    alert(newMsg);
//  }

</script>

<h2>jQuery</h2>
<p>You should use jQuery for these parts.</p>
<p>We didn't include jQuery in this document, though&mdash;so your first task is to include it!</p>
<div class="hint">
  <div>
    Remember you need a script tag in the head of this page that pulls in jQuery's source code.
  </div>
</div>



<h3>Finding the Button</h3>
<p>
  When you click this button, pop up an alert box. <b>Remember, you cannot change the HTML!</b>
</p>

<fieldset>
  <input type="button" class="find-me" value="Pop-Up Please!">
</fieldset>

<script>
  "use strict";
  // code here for above problem
</script>

<div class="hint">
  <div>
    You can find things by class name.
  </div>
</div>



<h3>Slowly Making a Porcupine</h3>
<p>
  After complaints from Joel about the lack of cute porcupines in our exercises,
  you're now tasked with having a cute porcupine appear when the button is pushed.
</p>
<p>However:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There must be a one second pause after the button is pushed before the image appears</li>
  <li>You should use a jQuery appear-via-animation method for this to appear. You can
  try things like <code>fadeIn</code> or <code>slideDown</code>. For extra points, can you
  make this animation itself happen slowly?</li>
</ul>

<fieldset>
  <img src="http://mytrial.typepad.com/.a/6a0147e199a17d970b0153906b3209970b-pi"
      id="cute-porcupine-image" style="display: none">
  <input type="button" id="make-a-porcupine" value="I Want a Porcupine!">
</fieldset>

<script>
  "use strict";
  // put your code here
</script>

<div class="hint">
  <div>
    Remember the <code>setTimeout</code> function we've used in lab.
    Alternatively, check out the .delay() method in jQuery.
  </div>
</div>



<h3>An Agreeable Form</h3>
<p>
  When the user submits the form below, it should fill in the div to agree with the
  user. So if I say my favorite food is "pretzels," a message should appear in that div
  that says, "I like pretzels, too."
</p>

<fieldset>
  <form action="/oh-no-do-not-go-here" id="agreeable-form">
    What's your favorite food?
    <input type="text" name="favorite-food" required
           id="favorite-food-input">
    <input type="submit" value="I'm Very Agreeable">
  </form>
  <div id="agreeable-text"></div>
</fieldset>

<script>
  "use strict";
  // put your code here
</script>

<div class="hint">
  <div>
    Remember how to find the current value in an input field
    using jQuery?
  </div>
</div>


<h3>Number Guessing Game</h3>
<p>
  Make the classic "guess-a-number-between-1-and-100" in JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
  The game should start when the user presses the play button. The function should first disable the button. The function should then pick a random integer from 1 to 100. Use the div with id 'number-guessing-msg' to ask the user to guess a number. This div will also display whether the guess was too high or too low. Once the user guesses the right number, three things should happen: first, the div should congratulate the player; second, the form should be disabled; third, the play button should be re-enabled.
</p>

<fieldset>
  <input type="button" id="play-guessing-game" value="Play!">
  <form action="do-not-go-here" id="guessing-game-form">
    <input id="number-guessed" name="number-guessed" type="number" placeholder="Guess" disabled>
    <!-- hey! go read MDN about the "number" input type. Cool, huh? -->
    <input type="submit" id="try-this-number" value="Guess" disabled>
    <div id="number-guessing-msg"></div>
  </form>
</fieldset>

<script>
  "use strict";
  // put your code here
</script>


<div class="hint">
  <div>
    How do you turn the string "42" into the integer 42 in JavaScript?
  </div>
</div>


<h3>Five Colored Primes</h3>
<p>
  When the button is pushed, five new circles should appear in the bordered area. Each circle should contain the next prime number, starting with 2. (A prime number is an integer greater than 1 which cannot be divided evenly by any other number other than itself and 1. For example, 11 is prime (you can only divide it by 1 and 11), while 12 is not (you can divide it evenly by 2, 3, 4, and 6, along with 1 and 12).
</p>
<p>
  Each box should have a different color, chosen from the list of colors in the JavaScript. You can re-use our <code>prime-circle</code> class to make your numbers look like ours, if you want (or feel free to experiment with other CSS).
</p>
<p>The result should look like:</p>
<div>
  <div class="prime-circle" style="background-color: orange">2</div>
  <div class="prime-circle" style="background-color: midnightblue">3</div>
  <div class="prime-circle" style="background-color: darkgoldenrod">5</div>
  <div class="prime-circle" style="background-color: green">7</div>
  <div class="prime-circle" style="background-color: purple">11</div>
</div>
<p>You must calculate the prime numbers; you cannot just hard-code them.</p>

<fieldset>
  <div id="prime-circle-area"><!-- Your prime circles should appear here! --></div>
  <input type="button" id="make-prime-circles" value="Button">
</fieldset>

<script>
  "use strict";

    var PRIME_COLORS = ['orange', 'midnightblue', 'darkgoldenrod', 'green', 'purple'];

  // put the rest of your code here
</script>



<h2>AJAX</h2>



<h3>Got Puppies?</h3>
<p>
  Who doesn't like puppies? No one, that's who! Fortunately, we've written a server to serve up as many cute puppies as one could ask for!
</p>
<p>
  Write code so that when the user clicks the "I want puppies!" button, an AJAX request gets sent to the route <code>/puppies.json</code> with the requested number of puppies from the form below, keyed to the name "num-puppies." The route will return the URL of a photo with the specified number of puppies. We've provided a callback function, <code>showPuppies</code>, which will use the results to show the puppies in the <code>puppies-go-here</code> div below.
</p>

<fieldset>
  <form id="puppy-form">
    How many puppies would you like?
    <select id="num-puppies" name="num-puppies">
      <option value="1">1 puppy</option>
      <option value="2">2 puppies</option>
      <option value="3">3 puppies</option>
      <option value="lots">A pile of puppies!</option>
    </select>
    <input type="submit" value="I want puppies!">
  </form>
  <div id="puppies-go-here"></div>
</fieldset>

<script>
  "use strict";

  // NOTE: DO NOT CHANGE THE CODE OF THIS FUNCTION
  function showPuppies(results) {
    //get the URL for the puppy photo out of the results object
    var puppyURL = results.url;

    //create a new img element and set its source to be the puppy URL
    var puppyPhoto = $("<img>").attr("src", puppyURL);

    //clear anything in the div and then add the img element
    $("#puppies-go-here").empty();
    $("#puppies-go-here").append(puppyPhoto);
  }

  // put your code here

</script>

<div class="hint">
  <div>
    What type of request makes more sense here, GET or POST?
  </div>
</div>


<h3>T-Rex Attack!!</h3>
<p>
  Ruler of the T-Rexes; Champion of Peace or Destroyer of Worlds?
</p>
<p>It all depends on the overall effectiveness of the attack.</p>
<p>
  Write code so that when the user submits the form, an AJAX request is made to the route <code>/t-rex-attack.json</code>. This route will expect the form value at the name "attack-target." The route will return the results of the T-Rex attack you launch: a summary of the havoc you wreaked and a reconnaissance image of the T-Rex you sent. We've provided a callback function, <code>showTRexResults</code>, to calculate the number of casualties and display the intel.
</p>
<p>
  With great power comes great responsibility. Go nuts.
</p>



<fieldset>
  <form id="t-rex-form">
    You're about to launch a T-Rex attack on
    <input id="t-rex-target" type="text" name="attack-target" placeholder="choose victim or location" required>
    <br>
    <input type="submit" id="attack" value="Launch Attack!">
  </form>
  <div id="t-rex-img" class="t-rex-results"></div>
  <div id="t-rex-response" class="t-rex-results"></div>
  <div id="t-rex-casualties" class="t-rex-results"></div>
</fieldset>

<script>
  "use strict";

  // NOTE: DO NOT CHANGE THE CODE OF THIS FUNCTION
  function showTRexResults(results) {

    //get the reaction string and image URL out of the results object
    var attackResult = results.reaction;
    var tRexURL = results.img;

    //create t-rex image element
    var tRexPhoto = $("<img>").attr("src", tRexURL);

    //calculate the number eaten by the T-Rex
    var numDead = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000);

    //clear and repopulate the appropriate spots
    $("#t-rex-target").val("");
    $(".t-rex-results").empty();
    $("#t-rex-response").append(attackResult);
    $("#t-rex-casualties").append("Innocent bystanders harmed: " + numDead);
    $("#t-rex-img").append(tRexPhoto);
  }

  // put your code here

</script>

<h3>CSS Stuff</h3>
<p>
  For those of you interested in more intermediate/complex
  CSS, take a look at the CSS we use on this page&mdash;it shows off some
  interesting pseudo-selectors like <code>:before</code> and uses things
  like CSS numbering. Neat stuff.
